##### I'm an avid basketball fan who enjoys web scraping and machine learning. 
##### Currently, I'm working on my NBA Stats discord bot that scrapes stats from basketball reference and displays them in discord through commands.
##### I am also beginning development on a Machine Learning Algorithm that will predict if a new player will enter the Hall of Fame by the end of their career.
